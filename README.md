Designed with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.
I decided to go with a carousel slide on the top of the page to make it more attractive.
Then I put up 2 customers testemonials just to make it more trustworthy.
After the customers testemonials I have put up the schedule for the classes.
I threw more images below the schedule for make user still scroll down the page.
After the gallery I have the location of the gym displayed there on the website.
